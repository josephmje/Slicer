#In this script, I run MRTRIX, for the purposes of obtaining noise residuals for each participant, which will be used in the QC process.
#These residual values indicate the amount of noise that "cannot be cleaned up from eddy". It is an arbitrary unit.
#It will provide a single average colume, which is the average of a 3D volume
#The DWI working group decided that, in addition to the eddy QC metrics, the noise value from mrtrix is useful
#Ultimately, the 5 eddy metrics and the single mrtrix metric will be combined in a PCA
#Before deciding to use, I should make sure that the noise value correlates as expected with all eddy metrics
#The first PC of the PCA will be used as a regressor indicating data quality

#The MRTRIX residuals are of interest to us for 2 reasons:
#1. We can QC the residual images
#2. In R, will combine this value with QC metrics from eddy, and run a PCA and extra the first component. This will be used as a covariate in analyses.
